# Support FTCLib

FTCLib is solely community-driven and currently is not the standard tool for programming in FTC. In order to get to that point, we need to garner a large audience. If you have worked with our library, consider using some of our branding tools that you can find under the [brand package](https://github.com/FTCLib/FTCLib/tree/v1.1.0/brand) in our repository. Spreading news by word of mouth also works and make sure to point them towards [our website](http://ftclib.org).

You can use our logo to put a sticker on your robot as seen here:

We would also greatly appreciate it if you would contribute to FTCLib. Make sure to read our [contributing page](https://github.com/FTCLib/FTCLib/blob/v1.1.0/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) on the GitHub for information on how to contribute. We are always willing to accept new pull requests. In fact, FTCLib is built on community contributions and would not have been possible if not for our contributors:
