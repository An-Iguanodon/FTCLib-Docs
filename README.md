# Welcome

FTCLib is the FTC library to end all libraries. By porting features from wpilib for FRC, FTCLib makes the use of advanced systems extremely easy for even rookie programmers. This wiki will teach you how to use the library and what each class means and represents. The first thing you should do is either download the project as a zip or fork the repository and use Git to clone the forked repository.
