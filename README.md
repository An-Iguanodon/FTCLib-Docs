# Welcome

FTCLib is a library designed to be the only library you'll need for FTC programming. The project was initially meant to be a port of WPILib, which is the standard programming library for FRC that almost all teams use. However, with FTC, there are a ton of libraries that not many people have heard about, especially rookie teams who are just starting. The goal of FTCLib is to improve the initial programming experience for new members as well as greatly enhance the efficiency of code for veterans.
